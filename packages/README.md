In this dir we will learn only about packages in Go

to start, you need to initialize go in this dir

```bash
go mod init firstGo
```
This create the the first module to you with firetGo name.

In the same dir there could be many files, but these files sould only contain one package

In the main go file, you should include your first entry point function `main` which will execute all in it.
