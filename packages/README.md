# Packages

In this dir we will learn only about packages in Go

In the same dir there could be many files, but these files sould only contain packages

In the main go file -parent of the current folder-, you should include your first entry point function `main` which will execute all in it.

* Please note that only one pkg can be added to this dir, also can be many files with different funcations but the same pkg name in all file.

You can add another pkg in another dir in the same parent package dir. like this one in `pkg2`.

The function name's first letter should be Upper case to be exposed to the main function.
